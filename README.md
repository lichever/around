### A Cloud and React based Social Network

* Deployed in AWS Amplify.

##### Backend
* Launched a scalable web service in Go to handle posts and deployed to Google Cloud (Google App Engine) 
* Used ElasticSearch (deployed to GCE) to provide search functions such that users can search recent posts and list personal posts.
